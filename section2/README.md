Exercise 1 & exercises 2/3 are implemented independently.

There is a code that is repeated between the scripts (e.g. `load_data`), but that's done becuase tasks are implemented independently with an assumption that it's not neccessary to reuse the code between them.

# Exercise 1: Correcting and Enhancing the Loss Calculation Script

`exercise1_losses_calculator.py` represents corrected loss calculation script.

Script assumes 5% as standard discount rate. If can't be assumed, script would have to ask for user input. The same way it asks for calculation period in years.

Script doesn't have external dependencies. Execute the following command in your terminal to use the script:

```
python exercise1_losses_calculator.py
```

# Exercise 2: Implementing a Complex Mathematical Loss Formula

`exercise2_complex_mathematical_loss_formula.py` represents complex mathematical loss calculation script.

This script also assumes 5% as standard discount rate.

Script doesn't have external dependencies. Execute the following command in your terminal to use the script:

```
python exercise2_complex_mathematical_loss_formula.py
```

# Exercise 3: Scaling the Loss Calculation Model
