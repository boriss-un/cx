Exercise 1 & 2/3 are implemented independently.

There is a code that is repeated between the scripts (e.g. `load_data`), but that's done becuase tasks are implemented independently with an assumption that it's not neccessary to reuse the code in them.

# Exercise 1: Correcting and Enhancing the Loss Calculation Script

# Exercise 2: Implementing a Complex Mathematical Loss Formula

# Exercise 3: Scaling the Loss Calculation Model
